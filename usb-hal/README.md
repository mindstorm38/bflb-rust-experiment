# USB Hardware Abstraction Layer
This crate provides an harware abstraction layer (HAL) for low-level control of USB devices. For now only EHCI registers are worked-on, providing USB 2.0 support.

The architecture of this crate is intentionnaly similar to [CherryUSB](https://github.com/sakumisu/CherryUSB).

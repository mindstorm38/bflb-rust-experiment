# BouffaloLab Rust Experiment
This repository is a Cargo workspace containing three lib crates and 
an example binary crate.

## BouffaloLab HAL
This is an HAL implementation for BouffaloLab chips. It currently only 
support BL808 as it's my main goal for now. It can be considered as a 
Rust port of the official Bouffalo SDK.

## BouffaloLab Runtime
This crate provides small runtime for building and linking binaries 
for targeting BouffaloLab chips. It also provides a bootstrap assembly
and interrupt handling.

## Embedded HAL utilities and runtime (PoC)
The crate `embedded-util` provides an alternative way of abstracting 
the embedded development in Rust. It provides utilities to generate 
peripherals and exclusive access to them. It aims to complete the 
official `embedded-hal` crate by providing a new way of defining 
Peripheral Access Crate (PAC), MMIO structures and bitfield registers.

## How to compile
Two targets must be installed to support both RV32 and RV64:
- `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`
- `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf`

The following commands can be used to compile the examples:
- `cargo build -p test-ox64-m0 --target riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf --release`
- `cargo build -p test-ox64-d0 --target riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf --release`

Get the binary file to flash:
- `cargo objcopy -p test-ox64-m0 --target riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf --release -- -O binary test-m0.bin`
- `cargo objcopy -p test-ox64-d0 --target riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf --release -- -O binary test-d0.bin`

## Under linux
Be sure to be in the right user group for opening the device file, then connect to it 
using: `picocom --echo --imap lfcrlf -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`.
